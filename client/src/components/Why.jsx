                tudents generally raise his/her voice on Instagram/Twitter.
                <br/><br/>
                But I think that if a student having small problem with his/her college he/she don't need to post anything on Twitter/Instagram.
                <br/><br/>
                After completing this project Kietians will be able to chat with his/her classmates/colleagues without creating any Unofficial/Official group in real time.
                <br/><br/>
                we will create Unofficial and Official groups separately and one for both.
                <br/><br/>
                If students wants to know about that particular person he/she can see his/her profile section.
                <br/><br/>
                User can post his/her problem so that anyone can see them and react on it publically.
                
                </span>
            </p><br/>
        </div>
    </>)
