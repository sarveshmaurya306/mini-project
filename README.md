* mini project for college 3rd sem


## Overview -
Students generally raise his/her voice on Instagram/Twitter.

But I think that if a student having small problem with his/her
college he/she don't need to post anything on Twitter/Instagram.

After completing this project Kietians will be able to chat with
his/her classmates/colleagues without creating any
Unofficial/Official group in real time.

we will create Unofficial and Official groups separately and one
for both.

If students wants to know about that particular person he/she
can see his/her profile section.

User can post his/her problem so that anyone can see them and
react on it publically.
